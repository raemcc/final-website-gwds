        <h1 class = "title">Reflecting on this project</h1>
        <p>
            I have included a few reflection paragraphs on each page of this website, but I will centralise them here. 
            . I completed the entirety of the CARP task in one day, and the typography tasks in two. This was more due to the fact I was left with very limited time for this whole project because I have been so ill. I would have liked to have more time to expand upon my evaluation of the individual pieces and try out some different layout ideas for the typography pieces.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I initially wasn't drawn to the typography task; in general I prefer the more structured coding work. 
            I found I enjoyed the challenge of the limited colour palette as it let me focus more on exactly 
            how captivating my typography was. I would say some were more successful than others, I think I 
            am particularly drawn to the ones with the more interesting backgrounds, i.e. the black and green. 
            I think the random system was my favourite style to complete, 
            and I think this abstract style of art is very interesting to me and something I will hopefully research a bit more.
        </p>

I really enjoyed completing the coding worksheets, I found them really helpful to look back on while I was making this very website! I didn't follow every instruction exactly - if I felt I had the general gist of something I didn't think there was much point repeating myself. I also did not complete the tasks centred around google fonts because that seemed pretty straightforward, and I wasnâ€™t too interested in implementing them in my site.
</p>
<p> I enjoyed learning about the Design Principles; at times I did find it hard to know when to stop, as it feels like I could always find some minute detail to improve upon.
    I found the learning curve to working with InDesign a little steeper than some of the 
    other software programs but by the end I was quite enjoying it. 
    I think when I came to doing the second drafts/iterations, an increase in the quality of my work can be seen for most of the posters. 

<p>Making this website has definitely developed my coding skills the most, far more than completing the worksheets or watching tutorials. I feel like I now have a pretty good understanding of flexbox and how to make something that kind of works. Its not perfect but I am proud of it for a first project. HTML and CSS are really fun languages to use, and I really enjoy being able to watch my website come to life and begin to navigate it in real time.
