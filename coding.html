            I really enjoyed completing these work sheets, I found them really helpful to look back on while I was making this very website!
            I didn't follow every instruction exactly - if I felt I had the general gist of something I didn't think there was much point repeating myself.
            I also did not complete the tasks centred around google fonts because that seemed pretty straightforward, and I wasnâ€™t too interested in implementing 
            them in my site. I referenced a few websites such as
            <a href=" https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ ">geeksforgeeks</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>
             and found these useful for un-picking errors and some of the more detailed flexbox stuff. To check out my completed coding worksheets
            head to <a href="https://github.com/raemcc/">github.com/raemcc/</a> where all my repositories are publically available!
